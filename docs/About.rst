About

I'm Robert, a quantitative finance graduate from the CQF program, with a strong interest
in the intersection of physics, statistics, finance, and computer science. For more about
my work, you can visit my `website <https://quantfin.net>`_.

I learn best through hands-on projects. In early 2020, I started self-educating in
quantitative finance, with a focus on algorithmic tradingâ€”a core area of the field.
After reading *Advances in Financial Machine Learning* by Dr. Marcos Lopez de Prado,
I wanted to implement some of the machine learning techniques presented in the book.
However, I soon realized that existing frameworks, like Mlfinlab, were closed source
and inaccessible to the public. While there were forks of the project, the code was outdated
and incompatible with modern libraries, such as Pandas 2.0 and the latest versions of Numpy.
This motivated me to develop Mlfinpy, a package with a well-documented and intuitive API designed
to be up-to-date and available to the broader community.
